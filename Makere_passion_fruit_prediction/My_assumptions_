I will be using faster rcnn as implementation concept to build my approach
RCNN:
https://github.com/ravirajsinh45/implementation_of_RCNN

here is the link to the competition: https://zindi.africa/competitions/makerere-passion-fruit-disease-detection-challenge

But it looks like rcnn are not end to end trainable detectors so let's check out a better approach:

We will try this one for multiclass, classification and object detection: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/10/12/multi-class-object-detection-and-bounding-box-regression-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/


Let's see how to tune faster RCNN models to improve performance
